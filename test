here’s no master branch locally anymore, because it’s renamed to the main branch.

To let others see the new main branch, you need to push it to the remote. This makes the renamed branch available on the remote.

$ git push --set-upstream origin main
Now we end up with the following state:

git branch --all
* main
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/origin/master
